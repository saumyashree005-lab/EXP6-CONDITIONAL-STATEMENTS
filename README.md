# Title : Study of conditional statement in Python

**THEORY**
- Conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions based on conditions.
 
- The if, elif, and else statements control the flow of execution of a program.

- Relational operators (>, <, ==, >=, <=) are used to compare values.

- Logical operators (and, or, not) help in checking multiple conditions at the same time.

- The modulo operator (%) is used to determine even or odd numbers.

- Conditional statements are useful in grading systems, number classification, and validations.

- Leap year checking uses mathematical conditions to handle calendar rules correctly.

- Date increment logic helps in understanding real-world date handling.

- These concepts improve logical thinking and problem-solving skills in programming

**ALGORITHMS**
- Algorithm 1: Check whether a number is Positive, Negative, or Zero
- Start
- Read a number from the user
- If number > 0, print Positive
- Else if number == 0, print Zero
- Else, print Negative
- Stop

-  Algorithm 2: Check whether a number is Even or Odd
- Start
- Read a number from the user
- If number modulo 2 equals 0, print Even
- Else, print Odd
- Stop

-  Algorithm 3: Find the Largest of Three Numbers
- Start
- Read three numbers from the user
- Compare first number with second and third
- If first is greatest, print it
- Else if second is greatest, print it
- Else, print the third number
- Stop

- Algorithm 4: Calculate Grade using If-Elif-Else
- Start
- Read marks from the user
- If marks ≥ 90, print Grade A
- Else if marks ≥ 75, print Grade B
- Else if marks ≥ 60, print Grade C
- Else if marks ≥ 40, print Grade D
- Else, print Fail
- Stop

- Algorithm 5: Check Leap Year
- Start
- Read year from the user
- If year divisible by 400, it is a leap year
- Else if year divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, it is a leap year
- Else, it is not a leap year
- Stop

- Algorithm 6: Increment a Date by One Day
- Start
- Read day, month, and year from the user
- Store number of days in each month
- Check leap year and update February days if required
- Increase day by 1
- If day exceeds month limit:
- Set day = 1
- Increase month by 1
- If month exceeds 12:
- Set month = 1
- Increase year by 1
- Display the next date
- Stop

- Algorithm 7 : Gross Salary Calculator
- Start

-Input basic salary

If basic = 10000
→ HRA = 20% of basic
→ DA = 80% of basic

Else if basic = 20000
→ HRA = 25% of basic
→ DA = 20% of basic

Otherwise
→ HRA = 30% of basic
→ DA = 95% of basic

Compute gross salary = basic + HRA + DA

Display basic salary and gross salary

Stop

Algorithm 8 : Income tax calculator
Start

Input annual income

If income ≤ 2,50,000 → tax = 0

Else if income ≤ 5,00,000
→ tax = 5% of (income − 2,50,000)

Else if income ≤ 10,00,000
→ tax = tax on previous slab + 20% of remaining income

Else
→ tax on previous slabs + 30% of remaining income

Display tax amount

Stop

CONCLUSION
These programs illustrate the effective use of conditional statements in Python for solving real-life problems.
They help in understanding decision-making logic, comparisons, and control flow.
Such concepts form the foundation for writing efficient and logical programs in Python.
